# Research and Anaysis on Y-Combinator Startup Accelerator

## Introduction
Y Combinator (YC) is an American technology startup accelerator launched in March 2005. It has been used to launch more than 3,000 companies, including Stripe, Airbnb, Cruise, PagerDuty, DoorDash, Coinbase, Instacart, Dropbox, Twitch, and Reddit, Inc.. The combined valuation of the top YC companies was more than $300 billion by January 2021.

YC program teaches founders to market their product, team, and market, refine their business model, achieve product/market fit, and scale the startup into a high-growth business, etc. The program ends with Demo Day, where startups present their business and sometimes technology to potential investors

YC Series A helps founders launch their A round. YC Growth Program provides founders with resources to scale their companies and hire an executive team, and YC Continuity invests in their later stage rounds.
